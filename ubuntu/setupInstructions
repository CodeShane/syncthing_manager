Create the user who should run the service, or choose an existing one.

Copy the Syncthing/etc/system/syncthing@.service file into the load path of the system instance.

Enable and start the service. Replace “bakman” with the actual Syncthing user after the @:

systemctl enable syncthing@bakman.service
systemctl start syncthing@bakman.service


#step 2
edit: /lib/systemd/system/syncthing@.service
change ExecStart line to:
ExecStart=/usr/bin/syncthing -home /etc/syncthing -no-restart -no-browser -logflags=0  >> "/etc/syncthing/log/syncthing_$(date +"%Y%m")" 2>/dev/null

run to reload file: 
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

check status or start / stop:
sudo systemctl status syncthing@bakman.service 
sudo systemctl start syncthing@bakman.service 
sudo systemctl stop syncthing@bakman.service
